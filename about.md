## Glider isn't about the typface, or the color, or the paper it's printed on. It's about the buttons and it's about Conway's Game of Life. 
## Kind of.

### About Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is an odd game. It's played by zero players on an infinite two dimensional board and can technically carry out any algorithm. Given different starting conditions, the game can reach a steady state almost instantly or it can go on forever.
The rules of the game are surprisingly simple. From the game's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):
>1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
>2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
>3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Just those three conditions are enough to generate amazingly complex patterns, from spaceships that traverse the board infinitely to a [simulation of the Game of Life within the game](https://youtu.be/xP5-iIeKXE8).

### The Magic of Spaceships, Meta-Life, and Turing Completeness 
Spaceships are patterns within Game of Life that will move across the board infinitely, or until they hit another pattern. Gliders are the simplest 
spaceship form, with five cells oscilating through four positions. Aside from just being interesting, gliders are incredibly useful in the Life
-within-Life linked above. The glider construct is also what makes the Game of Life Turing complete, meaning the game could theoretically 
replace a coding language like Python or Java. Alan Zucconi has an excellent [video](https://youtu.be/Kk2MH9O4pXY) demonstrating the construction of a computer in Life, from 
basic logic circuts to a Full Universal Turing Machine and an 8-bit programmable computer.

### About Glider

I said earlier that Glider is about buttons and the Game of Life. That's not completely true.

The figures on the buttons aren't just re-interpretations of cellular automata for physical space. They're also portraits of humanity. 

Like a glider, you continously move through space and time, forever forging a path into the future. Like a glider, you're also a part of systems far larger than yourself, moving and changing around you.
