## Artist Statement

*Glider* is an edition of buttons and corresponding cards distributed on the Reed College campus. Each button is printed with one of two glider formations from Conway’s Game of Life and is attached to a card printed with the other formation.

Conway’s Game of Life is an odd game. It’s played by no players on an infinite board with incredibly simple rules. The board is broken up into cells, which are either alive or dead. Each turn of the game, the cells update their status based on three rules. From the game’s Wikipedia page, “Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.”

Through these simple rules, Life can form complex patterns that may never resolve to a steady-state. One of these patterns is called a glider. Gliders are arrangements of five cells that will flow across the board forever. The endless motion of the gliders is part of what makes the Game of Life Turing complete, or able to run any algorithm you want. Gliders act as signals in computers built within life and are crucial to the Game of Meta-Life, or Life played within another game of Life. 

The buttons that make up *Glider* act in a similar fashion. When they are donned, they move through time and space endlessly and participate in systems far bigger than themselves. 

Apart from being inspired by the structure of the Game of Life, *Glider* is heavily influenced by the creative appearance of esoteric coding languages, particularly when they are rendered outside a text editor. One example is the project over/under by Alice Strete, published in code::art Issue 0, which “weaves” text based on a series of inputs. Another inspiration, from the same issue, is the work Tree? by Juan Alberto Martínez, a tree-shaped program that randomly generates random smaller trees.

*Glider* is also inspired by the buttons passed out at early computing trade shows. Many are designed to spread a specific message, “use this programming language!” or “buy our new system!”, but only to people who already know about the relevant company. The buttons in the Computer History Museum’s collection include one with an ASCII winking face emoji promoting a now-defunct website (catalog number 102657418) and another has a company’s name printed phonetically (catalog number E1242). Buttons like these inspired me to use buttons to spread information intelligible only to people already familiar with the concepts of Conway’s Game of Life.





<!--The Game of Life is an odd game. It's played by zero players on an infinite two dimensional board and can technically carry out any algorithm. Given different starting conditions, the game can reach a steady state almost instantly or it can go on forever.
The rules of the game are surprisingly simple. From the game's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):
>1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
>2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
>3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Just those three conditions are enough to generate amazingly complex patterns, from spaceships that traverse the board infinitely to a [simulation of the Game of Life within the game](https://youtu.be/xP5-iIeKXE8).

### A Little More About the Game of Life
Spaceships are patterns within Game of Life that will move across the board infinitely, or until they hit another pattern. Gliders are the simplest 
spaceship form, with five cells oscilating through four positions. Aside from just being interesting, gliders are incredibly useful in the Life
-within-Life linked above. The glider construct is also what makes the Game of Life Turing complete, meaning the game could theoretically 
replace a coding language like Python or Java. Alan Zucconi has an excellent [video](https://youtu.be/Kk2MH9O4pXY) demonstrating the construction of a computer in Life, from 
basic logic circuts to a Full Universal Turing Machine and an 8-bit programmable computer.

### About Glider

I said earlier that Glider is about buttons and the Game of Life. That's not completely true.

The figures on the buttons aren't just re-interpretations of cellular automata for physical space. They're also portraits of humanity. 

Like a glider, you continously move through space and time, forever forging a path into the future. Like a glider, you're also a part of systems far larger than yourself, moving and changing around you. -->
