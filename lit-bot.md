Lit Bot, [@fake_literature](https://twitter.com/fake_literature), is a robot account that generates quotes from classic literature that doesn't actually exist.

>"Let me see that the Gryphon and then said It WAS a narrow escape!" said the Cat went on saying to her but those serpents! There was no doubt only Alice did not feel encouraged to ask help of any one of the table.

>-_Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll, interpreted by [@fake_literature](https://twitter.com/fake_literature)

## How does it work?
Every time [@fake_literature](https://twitter.com/fake_literature) tweets, it scans a work of literature and keeps track of what sets of words appear together. The bot uses that data to construct totally fake tweet-length excerpts one word at a time by picking the next word semi-randomly based on the previous two words, similar to the process of picking events with a Markov chain.
