## Printing the Cards
The button cards were printed printed using shina woodblocks, a kind of Japanese lime. The first step after carving the blocks is proofing, making test prints to garuntee the block is exactly how you want it.

Proofing means printing, carving, re-printing, and re-carving until you get a print you like. Once I got the noise, stray bits of inked wood, under control, I can get to printing the full edition. 

## Printing the Buttons
The buttons themselves were printed on the same paper using hand-set type. The first step in printing type is to pull out the type you want from the racks and racks of different fonts. I used a font called Optima, which you can see in the case below. After the type is pulled out and spaced correctly, you can slide it into the press and start printing.

Using a letterpress is a lot simpler than woodblock printing. Just slide the paper in, ink the type, then turn the crank.

After the full edition of plain buttons were printed, I had the chance to experiment with printing on more exciting paper.

## Putting it all Together
The next step was to pull out the button maker and assemble all of the buttons. To prepare the paper, I had to use a die-cutter to cut out every glider.

Once a circle was cut, I could put it into the button maker, along with a piece of clear plastic film and a pin back, and press down.

I finally found a use for all those colorful test prints; more buttons!

I ended up with 78 buttons in the regular edition and 22 special edition buttons for a total of 100.
