Hi, I'm Mollie Boor! I'm a first-year CS student at Reed College, a small school in Portland, OR. Use the links above to learn more about me and my projects. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/mollie-boor) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mboorj).

When I don't have my nose buried in a book or in my laptop, I enjoy knitting, sound design, and exploring the city with my vintage film camera. I'm also on the Reed mock trial team and a member of the Students With Disabilities Coallition.
