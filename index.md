Hi, I'm Mollie Boor! I'm a first-year CS student at Reed College, a small school in Portland, OR. Use the links above to learn more about me and my projects.

When I don't have my nose buried in a book or in my laptop, I enjoy knitting, printmaking, and exploring the city with my vintage film camera.
